1. Printing numbers from 0 to 101:
for i in range(102):  # The range function goes up to, but not including, the stop value.
    print(i)


2. Printing numbers from 1 to 101:
for i in range(1, 102):  # The range function goes up to, but not including, the stop value.
    print(i)

3. Creating a list of numbers from 1 to 101:
numbers = []
for i in range(1, 102):
    numbers.append(i)
print(numbers)

    
4. Using a list comprehension to create a list of numbers from 1 to 101 (more concise):
numbers = [i for i in range(1, 102)]
print(numbers)




Then run:
python3 102_numbers.py > 101.txt

cat 102.txt


_______________________
NOTES:
-range(1, 102) generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and ending at 101.
-The for loop iterates through each number in this sequence. 
-print(i) displays each number.
-numbers.append(i) adds each number to the numbers list.
-List comprehension [i for i in range(1, 102)] provides a compact way to build a list.
